434,434,D_Dunne2,"@SamWallaceTel @Paulpatty @TelegraphDucker There’s no issues with him announcing the full cost of the whole lot including transfer fee, wages, agent fees, flights, meal deal etc as long as he does it for the likes of United and Liverpool too, which he doesn’t. Apparently Sancho was just £77m and he doesn’t get paid wages.",0.5267,0.867,0.037,0.095,Positive
435,435,E93Jack,@EPLIndex @TeleFootball @TelegraphDucker @SamWallaceTel @mcgrathmike Sancho annual wage of 18.2million. That over 6 seasons is 109.2 million.

He has improved but I still think he’s very overrated just like Sancho and Werner.
The maximum fee for him should be 40.
